Welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/" title="Maths&Stats">School of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" title="UoG">University of Glasgow</a>, which I joined in May 2018 to I work with <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/dirkhusmeier/" title ="DH">Prof. Dirk Husmeier</a>.  
My position is within the <a href="http://softmech.org/" title="SofTMech">SofTMech Centre</a>, an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics with applications to heart and cancer.  
I work on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations. My current project is concerned with Bayesian optimisation and non-parametric Bayesian statistics using Gaussian processes applied to left ventricle modelling.

I did my PhD at the <a href="http://www.vu.nl" title="VU">VU Amsterdam</a>, <a href="https://sbe.vu.nl/en/departments-and-institutes/econometrics-and-or/index.aspx" title="EOR">Department of Econometrics and OR </a>, and <a href="http://www.tinbergen.nl" title="TI">Tinbergen Institute</a>. I was working <a href="http://sjkoopman.net/" title="SJK">Prof. Siem Jan Koopman</a> and <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/lennart-hoogerheide" title="LH">Dr Lennart Hoogerheide</a> on developing methods for accurate and efficient Bayesian inference for time series analysis, with a particular focus on applications in econometrics and finance.  
I was visiting <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~rking33/" title="RK">Prof. Ruth King</a> at the <a href ="http://www.ed.ac.uk/" title="UoE">University of Edinburgh</a>, <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/research/statistics" title="SoM">the School of Mathematics</a> during Spring 2017. 

#### My main research interests:

<ul>
<li> Bayesian methods</li>
<li> Time series analysis (especially state space models)</li>
<li> Monte Carlo methods (MCMC, SMC, ABC)</li>
<li> Data analysis (including rare events)</li>
<li> Machine learning (e.g. Bayesian optimisation)</li>
</ul>

Besides, I am interested in code optimization, deep learning and adaptive importance sampling.
