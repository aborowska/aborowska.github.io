Welcome to my website!
I am an adjunct faculty at the [School of Business and Economics][EOR], [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam][VU].
My research interests lie in the area of Bayesian and computational statistics and econometrics. My work has focused on developing efficient sampling-based algorithms for prediction and inference in different contexts, such as time series forecasting, risk evaluation, state space models, and high-dimensional problems with intractable likelihood. 

Previously I was a research associate in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics][MathsStats], [University of Glasgow][UoG], working with [Dirk Husmeier][DirkHusmeier] on computer-intensive statistical methods for soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations. I worked  within two EPSRC funded projects, the [Closed-Loop Data Science][CLDS]  (CLDS) centre and [SofTMech][SofTMech]. My CLDS work concentrated on incorporating feedback effects into healthcare prognostication systems. In SofTMech, my research was mostly related to inference and uncertainty quantification in  biomechanical models.  

I did my PhD at the [Department of Econometrics and OR][EOR] (now the School of Business and Economics), [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam][VU], and the [Tinbergen Institute][TI], under the supervision of [Siem Jan Koopman][SiemJanKoopman] and [Lennart Hoogerheide][LennartHoogerheide]. I worked on developing methods for accurate and efficient Bayesian inference for time series analysis, with a particular focus on applications in Econometrics and Finance. In Spring 2017 I visited [Ruth King][RuthKing] at the [School of Mathematics][SchoolMath], the [University of Edinburgh][UoE], to work on efficient algorithms for Bayesian inference in state space models.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics][MIMUW], the [University of Warsaw][UW], and a Master's degree in Economics from the [Warsaw School of Economics][SGH].

In 2021 and 2023 I was on maternity leaves.
