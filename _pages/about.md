Welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics][MathsStats] at the [University of Glasgow][UoG], which I joined in May 2018 to I work with [Dirk Husmeier][DirkHusmeier].  
My position is within the [SofTMech][SofTMech], an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics with applications to heart and cancer.  
I work on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations. My current project is concerned with Bayesian optimisation and non-parametric Bayesian statistics using Gaussian processes applied to left ventricle modelling.

I did my PhD at the [Department of Econometrics and OR][EOR], [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam][VU], and [Tinbergen Institute][TI]. I was working [Siem Jan Koopman][SiemJanKoopman] and [Lennart Hoogerheide][LennartHoogerheide] on developing methods for accurate and efficient Bayesian inference for time series analysis, with a particular focus on applications in econometrics and finance.  
In Spring 2017 I visited [Ruth King][RuthKing] at the [School of Mathematics][SchoolMath], [School of Mathematics][SchoolMath]. 

#### My main research interests:

* Bayesian methods
* Time series analysis (especially state space models)
* Monte Carlo methods (MCMC, SMC, ABC)
* Data analysis (including rare events)
* Machine learning (e.g. Bayesian optimisation)

Besides, I am interested in code optimization, deep learning and adaptive importance sampling.
