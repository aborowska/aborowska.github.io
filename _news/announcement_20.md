Due to the Covid-19 outbreak both the [ABC in Grenoble Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/abc-in-grenoble/) and the [British Applied Mathematics Colloquium](https://sites.google.com/site/bmcbamc2020/home) will unfortunately not take place as planned, with the former having been cancelled and the latter postponed until 2021. Please all take care!
