I have accepted a position of a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics  at the  School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow to work with Professor Dirk Husmeier. The position is within the [__SofTMech Centre__](http://softmech.org) (SofTMech) (an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics) and I will carry out research on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations.
