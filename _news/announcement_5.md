I have accepted a position of a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow to work with Professor [Dirk Husmeier][DirkHusmeier]. The position is within the [__SofTMech Centre__][SofTMech] (an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics) and I will carry out research on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations.
