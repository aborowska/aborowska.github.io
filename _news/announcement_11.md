With Diana Giurghita we have won [Model 3](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/conferences/cside2018/models/model3/)
and [Additional Challenge](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/conferences/cside2018/models/additionalchallenge/)
in [Cside 2018](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/conferences/cside2018/) (with a great support from [Dirk Husmeier](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/dirkhusmeier/)).
Cside stands for _Competitive statistical inference for differential equations_ and is a competition funded by [The Biometrika Trust](https://academic.oup.com/biomet) and sponsored by [SofTMech](http://www.softmech.org/). Both [Model 3](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/conferences/cside2018/models/model3/)
and [Additional Challenge](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/conferences/cside2018/models/additionalchallenge/) are concerned with cell migration. More precisely, the data are generated from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) system describing cell migration due to chemotaxis and the aim of both subcompetitions was to infer the parameters of the SDE system underlying the provided data.
