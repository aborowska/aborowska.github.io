My travel award grant application to attend the [39th International Symposium on Forecasting](https://isf.forecasters.org/) has been accepted - many thanks to the Organisers! 
At the Symposium, to be held from the 16th to the 19th June 2019 in Thessaloniki, Greece, I will present my paper [_Bayesian Risk Forecasting for Long Horizons_](/projects/2_project.markdown).
