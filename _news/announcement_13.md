I will present my work on Bayesian optimisation for biomechanical model of the left ventricle at the [workshop on uncertainty quantification for cardiac models](http://www.newton.ac.uk/event/FHTW01) organised by the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge. The workshop will be held from the 5th to the 7th June 2019.
